# WHO-QOL

A web platform focusing on WHO Quality of Life (QOL) has been developed in collaboration with my teammates Pragati Bhat, Khushi Patil, and Tejas C. N, empowering teaching, non-teaching, and office staff to assess their quality of life through responses to 26 questions formulated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The platform efficiently calculates scores across physical, psychological, social, and environmental dimensions. Users not only have the capability to view their current scores but also access their historical scores. Additionally, they can compare their scores with the average and examine overall scores categorized by gender and designation for teaching, non-teaching, and office staff. Furthermore, the platform offers personalized suggestions based on the scores to guide individuals on how to enhance their well-being in the realms of physical, psychological, social, and environmental aspects.
