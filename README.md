KLE Technological University,Hubli students have developed the WHO Quality of Life (QOL) web platform. This platform allows teaching, non-teaching, and office staff to assess their quality of life by responding to 26 questions formulated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The platform calculates scores across physical, psychological, social, and environmental dimensions. Users can not only view their current scores but also access their historical scores, compare their scores with the average, and examine overall scores categorized by gender and designation for teaching, non-teaching, and office staff
